# 🧠 End-to-End Data Analyst Project – Customer Behavior Analysis

This project demonstrates a **complete end-to-end data analysis pipeline** — from raw data cleaning and transformation in Python, to SQL-based analysis, and finally to interactive Power BI dashboards for visualization.  
The goal was to analyze **customer behavior** and uncover insights that help drive **data-driven business decisions**.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

**Project Title:** Customer Behavior Analysis  
**Tools & Technologies:** Python (Pandas), SQL (PostgreSQL), Power BI  
**Objective:** Understand customer spending patterns, subscription behavior, and product performance to support better marketing and business strategies.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### 1. 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python – Pandas)
- Imported raw CSV data into **Jupyter Notebook**.
- Performed **data inspection** and **descriptive statistics**.
- Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized column names.
- Categorized customers by **age groups** and normalized purchase frequency data.
- Exported the cleaned dataset for database storage.

📈 *Outcome:* Created a clean, structured, and analysis-ready dataset.

---

### 2. 🗄️ Data Storage & Management (PostgreSQL)
- Loaded the cleaned dataset into **PostgreSQL** using **SQLAlchemy**.
- Structured tables for efficient querying and relational analysis.
- Ensured data integrity for further SQL-based insights.

📈 *Outcome:* Built a robust database ready for business analysis.

---

### 3. 🧾 Data Analysis (SQL)
Performed SQL queries to answer key business questions and uncover customer insights.

#### Example Questions:
| No | Business Question | Key Insight |
|----|--------------------|-------------|
| Q1 | What is the total revenue generated by male vs female customers? | Gender-based spending insights |
| Q2 | Which customers used discounts but still spent more than average? | Identified high-value discount users |
| Q3 | Which are the top 5 products with the highest average review rating? | Found best-performing products |
| Q4 | Compare average purchase amount between Standard vs Express shipping. | Delivery preference impact |
| Q5 | Do subscribed customers spend more than non-subscribers? | Subscribed users show higher spend |
| Q6 | Which 5 products have the highest percentage of discounted purchases? | Discount-heavy products identified |
| Q7 | Segment customers into New, Returning, and Loyal based on purchase history. | Customer segmentation insights |
| Q8 | What are the top 3 most purchased products within each category? | Product-category level trends |
| Q9 | Are repeat buyers (5+ purchases) more likely to subscribe? | Loyalty linked with subscription rate |

📈 *Outcome:* Extracted actionable insights about customer loyalty, discount behavior, and product performance.

---

### 4. 📊 Data Visualization (Power BI)
- Built interactive **Power BI dashboards** to visualize:
  - Gender-based revenue comparison  
  - Product performance metrics  
  - Subscription and discount analysis  
  - Customer segmentation (New / Returning / Loyal)
- Designed a modern, professional layout using blue & white corporate color schemes.

📈 *Outcome:* Delivered a data-driven, interactive dashboard for decision-makers.
